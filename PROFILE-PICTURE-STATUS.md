# 📸 Profile Picture Status - UPDATED!

## ✅ **FIXED AND READY!**

Your profile picture is now properly configured to use your image:

### **Current Setup:**
- **Your Image File**: `public/images/tabish-ali-profile.jpg.jpeg` ✅
- **Code Updated**: Points to your exact filename ✅
- **Error Handling**: Falls back to placeholder if needed ✅
- **Console Logging**: Shows success/error messages ✅

### **Code Implementation:**
```jsx
<img
  src="/images/tabish-ali-profile.jpg.jpeg"
  alt="Tabish Ali - Frontend Developer"
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  onLoad={() => console.log("✅ Tabish's profile image loaded successfully!")}
  onError={(e) => {
    console.log("❌ Profile image failed to load, using fallback");
    e.currentTarget.src = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507003211169-0a1dd7228f2d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80";
  }}

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting (if needed):**

### **If you see the placeholder instead of your photo:**

1. **Check File Location:**
   - Make sure `tabish-ali-profile.jpg.jpeg` is in `public/images/` folder
   - File should be exactly: `public/images/tabish-ali-profile.jpg.jpeg`

2. **Check File Size:**
   - If image is very large (>5MB), try resizing it
   - Recommended: 400x400 pixels, under 1MB

3. **Check File Format:**
   - Your file has double extension `.jpg.jpeg`
   - This should work, but you could rename to:
     - `tabish-ali-profile.jpg` OR
     - `tabish-ali-profile.png`

4. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
